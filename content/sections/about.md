Dialect is a translation application targeted at the GNOME desktop, but also compatible with the free desktop ecosystem in general. It is designed to support multiple online translation sources such as LibreTranslate, DeepL, Google, Lingva Translate, Bing, Yandex and others.

It also supports other handy features like translation history, text to speech and clipboard integration.

The application started as a simple Google Translate client in 2020 and quickly grew in terms of contributions and features.
